# DatabaseAssignments

This repo contains all of the assignments that I have completed when I took ECE356 Database Systems Course.

# Highlights
- Mastery of SQL statements to query from large sets of data
- Used indexing and hashing to perform faster queries
- Used decesion trees to perform Data mining on baseball statistics to determine which player will likely be nominated in the hall of fame and or will actually win a place in the hall of fame.
- Scrapped relevant data using SQL queries, created and trained classifers using Python, then tested the classifier with a test set of the database.

- Please download the report as it explains what was done for the data mining project in greater detail .https://github.com/n27jain/DatabaseAssignments/blob/main/A4_Data_Mining/sol/report.docx
